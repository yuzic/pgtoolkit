=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<pg_compactor> is a maintenance tool for PostgreSQL to reduce bloat
for tables without heavily locking them.

The tool is an automation of the solutions described on the pages:

=item L<Reducing bloat without locking|http://blog.endpoint.com/2010/09/reducing-bloat-without-locking.html>

by Joshua Tolley (on End Point's blog)

by Hubert Lubaczewski (aka Depesz).

If pgstattuple is installed B<pg_compactor> uses it to gather a better
statistics. It is highly recommended if there are a lot of toast data
in the database.

=item B<-v> LEVEL

=item B<--verbosity> LEVEL

A verbosity level. One of C<error>, C<warning>, C<notice>, C<info>. By
default C<notice>.

=back

=head2 Connection options

The B<pg_compactor> tries to connect to the database with the DBI
Perl module using either DBD::Pg or DBD::PgPP driver first. If it
fails the utility tries to work via psql.

=over 4

=item B<-h> HOST

=item B<--host> HOST

A database host. By default C<localhost>.

=item B<-p> PORT

=item B<--port> PORT

A database port. By default C<5432>.

=item B<-U> USER

=item B<--user> USER

A database user. By default current system user is used (as returned
by whoami).

=item B<-W> PASSWD

=item B<--password> PASSWD

A password for the user.

=item B<-P> PATH

=item B<--path-to-psql> PATH

A path to the psql program. By default C<psql>.

=back

=head2 Targeting options

Note that if you specified a database, schema or table that is not in
the cluster it will be ignored. Redundant exclusions will be ignored
too. All this options except C<--all> can be specified several times.

=item B<--all>

Process all databases of the cluster.

=item B<-d> DBNAME

=item B<--dbname> DBNAME

A database to process. By default all the user databses of the
instance are processed.

=item B<-D> DBNAME

=item B<--exclude-dbname> DBNAME

A database to exclude from processing.

=item B<-n> SCHEMA

=item B<--schema> SCHEMA

A schema to process. By default all the schemas of the specified
database are processed.

=item B<-N> SCHEMA

=item B<--exclude-schema> SCHEMA

A schema to exclude from processing.

=item B<-t> TABLE

=item B<--table> TABLE

A table to process. By default all the tables of the specified schema

=item B<-T> TABLE

=item B<--exclude-table> TABLE

=item B<-L>

=item B<--no-final-analyze>

Turn off final analyze. By default is on.

=item B<-r>

=item B<--reindex>

Reindex tables after processing.

=item B<-s>

=item B<--print-reindex-queries>

requirements.

=item B<--max-pages-per-round> PAGES

An upper threshold of pages to process per round. By default it is 10.

=item B<-e> SECONDS

=item B<--delay-constant> SECONDS

A constant part of the delay between rounds in seconds. By default it
is 0.

=item B<-E> RATIO

=item B<--delay-ratio> RATIO

A dynamic part of the delay between rounds is calculated as
previous-round-time * delay-ratio. By default 2.

=item B<-o> COUNT

=item B<--max-retry-count> COUNT

A maximum number of retries in case of unsuccessful processing. By
default 10.

=item B<-x> COUNT

=item B<--min-page-count> COUNT

A minumum pages number required to be in the table to process it. By
default it is 10.

=item B<-y> RATIO

=item B<--min-free-percent> RATIO

A minimum free space percent required to be in the table to process
it. By default it is 5.

=item B<-z> SECONDS

=item B<--progress-report-period> SECONDS

An interval in seconds to report the progress of processing
with. Default is 60 seconds.
