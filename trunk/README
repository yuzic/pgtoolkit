PgToolkit is a set of scripts for PostgreSQL database maintenance and
monitoring by PostgreSQL-Consulting.com.

The easiest way to deploy the toolkit is to get the latest version of
the autonomous scripts archive pgtoolkit-vX-fatscripts.tar.gz from the
PgToolkit project's site on Google Code.

http://code.google.com/p/pgtoolkit/downloads/list

These scripts are packed with all the required dependencies so you
will need to have Perl installed only. Just unpack it and enjoy.

Another way is to checkout the source code from the project's
repository.

svn checkout http://pgtoolkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pgtoolkit

All the scripts are in the bin/ directory. To make them work the
PERL5LIB environment variable must be set to the lib/ directory.

Tools we have prepared for publishing:

- pgcompactor - a tables and indexes bloat reducing tool.

The list of changes can be found in the CHANGES file. PgToolkit is
released under the PostgreSQL License, read the COPYRIGHT file for
additional information.
