PgToolkit is a set of scripts for PostgreSQL maintenance and
monitoring by PostgreSQL-Consulting.com.

The first way to deploy the toolkit is to get the latest version of
the autonomous scripts archive pgtoolkit-vX-fatpack.tar.gz from the
PgToolkit project's download page on Google Code:

http://code.google.com/p/pgtoolkit/downloads/list

These scripts are packed with all the required dependencies so you
will need to have Perl installed only. Just unpack it and enjoy.

Another way is to checkout the source code from the project's
repository:

svn checkout http://pgtoolkit.googlecode.com/svn/tags/vX/ pgtoolkit

The workdir contains a fatpack/ directory. It also houses the
autonomous scripts so you can use them straight away.

If you want to use non-autonomous versions of these scripts you will
find them in the bin/ directory. To make them work the PERL5LIB
environment variable must be set to the lib/ directory.

Presented tools:

- pgcompact - a tables and indexes bloat reducing tool.
