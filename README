PgToolkit - tools for PostgreSQL maintenance and monitoring

- pgcompact - tables and indexes bloat reducing tool.

The easiest way to deploy the toolkit is to get the latest version of
the autonomous scripts archive pgtoolkit-vX-fatpack.tar.gz from the
project page http://code.google.com/. These scripts are packed with
all the required dependencies so you will need to have Perl installed
only. Just unpack it to your bin directory and enjoy.

Another way is to checkout the source code from the project's
repository:

  $ svn co http://pgtoolkit.googlecode.com/svn/tags/vX/ pgtoolkit

The work directory contains a fatpack directory. It also houses the
autonomous scripts so you can use them straight away. If you want to
use non-autonomous versions of these scripts you will find them in the
bin directory. To make them work the PERL5LIB environment variable
must be set to the lib directory.
