PgToolkit from Postgresql-consulting.com
========================================

PgToolkit is a set of scripts for PostgreSQL database
management. Initially it was an internal set of tools and instructions
in the postgresql-consulting.com but we decided to share our
experience with public some times ago and created this project.

There are two ways to deploy and use the tools.

The first and the easiest one is to get the last version of the
autonomous scripts archive from the project's site on Google Code
http://code.google.com/p/pgtoolkit/. Unpack it on the destination
machine and simply use. This scripts are packed with all the
dependencies so you need the Perl interpreter installed only.

Another way is to checkout the source code from the project's
site. All the scripts you will find in the "bin" directory. Before
using any of them the the PERL5LIB environment variable must be set to
point to the "lib" directory.

To get more information about any tool just run it with the "--help"
option.

There is the only tool ready for publishing currently:

pg_compactor - a PostgreSQL table bloat reducing tool.

Also we have not adapted any instructions to the publication yet but
they are comming soon.
